# Code Refactoring Homework

This repository contains my first _exceptionally coded_ homework assignment.

In this assignment we address accessibility issues within existing code for a marketing agency called Horiseon. I found this first assignment especially relavent as I work with adults with disabilities who use devices like screen readers, and this type of code refactoring directly affects their lives. So - it's super cool that you chose to address this first.

Aside from adding semantic HTML elements for increased accessibility, much of this assignment focused on just cleaning up the existing code and making it more user-friendly and easier to follow. There were numerous redundancies and code that needed to be consolidated in the CSS file. If a future developer needed to quickly go in and adjust something, it would have been difficult for them to navigate to the appropriate area to make the change, and they would have likely needed to make the same change in three or four different places to achieve the desired effect. The refactored code is clear, concise, comprehensive, and accessible.
